                Dear Bebe,
            </p>
            <p class="black">
                I would like to apologize kasi late kitang na-ask to be my Valentine. I'm sorry po if I couldn't meet your preferences and expectations when I should have. Bebe, for me kasi, it's better to ask you days before V-Day, not weeks or months before.
                <br><br>
                I'm sorry po ulit, bebe ko. But please do know that I really, really love you, and I always appreciate you po, no matter what.
                <br><br>
                HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY PO, BEBE KO! ❤️❤️
            </p>
